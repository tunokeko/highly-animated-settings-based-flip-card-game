FLIPPING CARD
it will rotate in y axis with an animation.When it is between 90 and 270 the image will be changed to Show the backside.

CARD MODEL
I will have a static image list and when initializing cards i will shuffle it and assign it to my current list

GAME SHAPE
when any element in the game shape is null,i will reverse its card animation back to 0 and if it has an image i will forward it to 1

If there are 2 equal images reverse them
